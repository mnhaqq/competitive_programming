CONTEST ANALYSIS

PROBLEM 1: KING'S SPEECH
I think I did well with this problem.
Solved it after 4 mins, could have been less but the time was still good.
Used formatted strings, which I think was the best approach for this problem,
since looking at my code it's very obvious what I was trying to do.

PROBLEM 2: DAKTI
This problem was a massive headache. Spent so much time on it and got 3 penalties
My main issue was that I assumed the numbers in the string were always going to be
single digit like in the test case.
So in all my failed submissions I was passing the given test case but failing others
which included numbers having more than 1 digit.
This was the last problem I solved, I skipped it and solved the third problem and even tried solving
the fourth one before coming back to this.
At a point I gave up when I was still getting errors and I couldn't even see the test case I was failing on
and didn't know what I was supposed to fix

PROBLEM 3: I_love_%username%
This problem was also relatively straightforward for me
This was the second problem I solved after skipping the second one
Almost all other solutions were similar to mine so I'm guessing my method was okay
My only regret here was that I could have solved this earlier if I looked at all problems
before starting to solve them. Because in my opinion this was more straightforward than the 
previous problem. I would have had a better time and rank if I moved to this quicker

PROBLEM 4 AND 5
I didn't really have enough time to look at these problems during the contest since I was struggling 
with problem 2
